# Sound of Sorting Task for the PLP Assignment 2


## How to run the project
Make sure to have the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Ideally, you can create a virtual environment folder. 




## Important Info
- On Windows WSL, the audioplay somehow did not work due to some bugs reported on WSL itself. However, on Mac (Apple Silicon) and generally linux the audio should play without any major issues.
- I did not manage to make the sound sychronous to the animation. After many hours of debugging, changing libraries, making adaptions, the changes did not resolve the issue I was having with playing the sound properly. I intentionally left the sound to show that there is actually one playing according to the compiled bar heights (so th ecalculation is correct), but the sound most often finished before the animation has finished. I added a checkbox to disable or enable to play the sound therefore.


## Recordings
The recording to show that the application is working can be found under /recording
